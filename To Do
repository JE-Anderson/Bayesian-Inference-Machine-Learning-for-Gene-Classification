# To Do List
This program works but needs to be optimized in a couple specific ways to majorly improve runtime.  Additionally, a very simple strategy was used for missing value replacement.  Implementation of a more comprehensive value replacement strategy could majorly improve the performance of the model.
1. Update/optimize methods for probability calculations.  The current approach calculates each probability as needed at the time of request.  This is very inefficient and causes the program to re-calculate the same values many times.  Update the program to calculate the overall probability for each class, and the probability for each potential tuple value by attribute so that these values are calculated once ahead of time and then referenced as needed.
2. Improve missing value replacement strategy.  Missing values for any given attribute were filled in with the mode for that attribute.  Implementing a more comprehensive value replacement strategy could improve accuracy significantly.
